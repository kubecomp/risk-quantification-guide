## 1. Scoring Model
- **Likelihood (1â€“5)**: 1 = Rare, 5 = Almost Certain
- **Impact (1â€“5)**: 1 = Negligible, 5 = Severe / Business-crippling
- **Risk Score = Likelihood x Impact**

| Score | Level      | Action                                |
|-------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1â€“5   | Low        | Accept / monitor                      |
| 6â€“10  | Medium     | Mitigate with planned controls        |
| 11â€“15 | High       | Immediate treatment, exec visibility  |
| 16â€“25 | Critical   | Escalate to Board; urgent mitigation  |

## 2. Example: Executive Summary
> **Top Risks â€“ Q3 2025**
> - **Unauthorized access to production (Score: 20 â€“ Critical)**  
>   Controls: MFA, SSO, IAM reviews. Residual: 8 (Medium).  
> - **Vendor data breach (Score: 15 â€“ High)**  
>   Controls: TPRM, DPAs, SOC 2 reviews. Residual: 9 (Medium).  
> - **Unpatched critical vulnerabilities (Score: 16 â€“ Critical)**  
>   Controls: Weekly scanning, SLA remediation. Residual: 6 (Medium).  

ðŸ“Š **Trend**: Critical risks reduced from 4 â†’ 2 since Q2 due to IAM improvements.

# IAM Access Review Checklist

## Frequency
- Quarterly for critical apps and infrastructure
- Semi-annual for lower-risk systems

## Steps
1. **Pull access list** from IAM tool, SSO, or system exports  
2. **Validate role alignment** â€“ each user has least-privilege role  
3. **Check joiner/mover/leaver events** â€“ confirm timely provisioning/deprovisioning  
4. **Flag orphaned accounts** â€“ disable or remediate immediately  
5. **Service accounts** â€“ validate justification, vaulting, and rotation  
6. **Document findings** â€“ approvals, revocations, risk acceptance  
7. **Report metrics** â€“ % of accounts reviewed, # of removals, exceptions  

âœ… Use evidence (tickets, signed review logs, system screenshots) for audits.
